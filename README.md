In a fast-paced, data-driven environment, understanding sales performance is key to optimizing business strategies. I am excited to share my Pizza Analytics Dashboard, designed to provide comprehensive insights into pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and overall business performance.

üìä Key Metrics & KPIs:

This dashboard allows for in-depth analysis of the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

Total Revenue: Track the total revenue generated by pizza sales over a defined period.
Average Order Value (AOV): Monitor the average value of each pizza order to identify sales trends.
Total Pizzas Sold: Quantify the total number of pizzas sold across all categories and timeframes.
Total Orders: Measure the volume of pizza orders placed.
Average Pizzas per Order: Analyze the average number of pizzas ordered per transaction.
üìà Interactive Visualizations:
The dashboard features a range of dynamic visualizations designed to highlight key trends and insights:

Daily Pizza Order Trend: Visualize daily fluctuations in pizza orders.
Monthly Pizza Order Trend: Analyze monthly trends to identify seasonal patterns and performance.
Hourly Trend for Pizza Orders: Understand how pizza sales vary by time of day.
Sales Distribution by Pizza Category: See the percentage of total sales attributed to each pizza category.
Sales Distribution by Pizza Size: Track how different pizza sizes contribute to overall sales.
Total Pizzas Sold by Category: Breakdown of pizzas sold across various categories.
Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas: Identify the best-performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.
Bottom 5 Sellers: Highlight the least-performing pizzas by revenue, sales volume, and order count.
üõ†Ô∏è Approaches & Tools Used:
To develop this dashboard, I utilized the following approaches:

SQL Server Management:

Data Aggregation: Leveraging SQL queries to aggregate sales data, calculate KPIs, and generate insights for all key metrics.
Complex Calculations: Writing custom SQL scripts to calculate specific metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and more.
Power BI:

Data Visualization: Using Power BI to design and deploy dynamic, interactive dashboards that enable in-depth analysis and easy exploration of sales data.
Canvas Layout: Crafting intuitive, user-friendly dashboards that present data in a clear and actionable format.
üîç How to Use:
Explore: Use filters and slicers to drill down into the data based on different time periods, pizza categories, or sizes.
Analyze: Interact with the visualizations to uncover meaningful insights and trends in pizza sales and customer behavior.
Report: Leverage these insights to make data-backed decisions that drive sales growth and operational improvements.

This Pizza Analytics Dashboard provides a powerful tool for restaurant owners, managers, and analysts to make informed decisions, optimize sales strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.
